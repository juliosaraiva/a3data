# Github Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines
1. **Be Clear and Concise**: When asking for code suggestions, be as specific as possible about what you need.
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant code snippets, error messages, or descriptions of the problem to help Copilot understand your request.
3. **Iterate on Suggestions**: If the initial suggestion isn't quite right, provide feedback or ask for modifications to refine the output.
4. **Use Comments**: Leverage comments in your code to indicate areas where you want Copilot to focus or provide alternatives.

## Code Snippet Structure
When providing code snippets, use the following structure:
```python
# Your code here
```
This helps Copilot understand the context and generate more accurate suggestions.

## Example Requests
- "Can you help me implement a function that calculates the factorial of a number?"
- "I'm getting an error when trying to connect to the database. Here's the relevant code snippet:"

## Troubleshooting Tips
1. **Check Logs**: Always check the application logs for any error messages or stack traces that can provide clues.
2. **Validate Inputs**: Ensure that all inputs to your functions are valid and properly formatted.
3. **Isolate the Problem**: Try to reproduce the issue in a minimal environment to isolate the cause.
4. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the official documentation for any libraries or frameworks you're using.
